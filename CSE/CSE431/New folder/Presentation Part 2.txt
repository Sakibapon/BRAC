PREVIOUS WORK

NEGation detection in perticular  has followed two different line of
research of work
Rule based: it finds cue words and scope. these methods are limited on
complex dataset
to overcome these problem ml approach was introduced.
however ml has its own issues. they require huge ammount of data to train.
and secondly Machine learning methods do not generalize well



to overcome some of the chanllengs in two decoder model architecture 
the author introduced shared decoder which has shared encoder and 
decoder representation however there are separate softmax layers 
for entity and negation tasks.
however it performed poorly
