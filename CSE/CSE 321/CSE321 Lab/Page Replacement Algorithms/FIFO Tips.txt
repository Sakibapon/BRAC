1. Take input of the pages required for a task in an array and fix
	the capacity.
2. You may use a method for calculating page faults
3. While performing insertion if the capacity is not full then
	Check if the page is present or not
	Each insertion before capacity not being full causes page fault.
4. If the capacity if full then 
	Check if the page is present or not
		If not present then remove the first element & shift 
		all element (if you use an array otherwise you can
		use build in Queue class)
		
		Then insert at the last available space.

5. For counting page faults always increment count while inserting
6. For counting page hits alwasys increment count after searching for
	a page in the array. 


BEST OF LUCK !!!
